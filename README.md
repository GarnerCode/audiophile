*This website was built as a challenge project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx)*

### Project Overview
For this project, I decided to make it more challenging by using only Nuxt, without the assistance of any other CSS or JavaScript libraries. This allowed
me to become more experienced in managing local storage, as well as dispatching and listening to events throughout the app, while developing a website that
is as light-weight as possible. Below are a few of the biggest challenges I faced while building audiophile.

### Challenges Overcome
- Building and styling complex layouts to match design
- Handling dynamic routes within Nuxt
- Managing cart state between local storage and the app
- Developing checkout form validation from scratch
